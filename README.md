Monk Conventions
================

Monk Conventions is a collection of coding and development conventions that the
development team at Monk adhears to.

Organization
------------

There should be one (Markdown)[https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown]
file per topic, whether that's a language, framework, tool, etc. For example,
all conventions dealing with the Ruby language should be placed in `ruby.md`.
Ruby on Rails conventions can be included in the same file, but should be split
out to `ruby_on_rails.md` when they become significant enough.
