Monk Conventions
================

Monk Conventions is a collection of coding and development conventions that the
development team at Monk adhears to.

Organization
------------

There should be one [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
file per topic, whether that's a language, framework, tool, etc. For example,
all conventions dealing with the Ruby language should be placed in `ruby.md`.
Ruby on Rails conventions can be included in the same file, but should be split
out to `ruby_on_rails.md` when they become significant enough.

Format
------

Each Markdown file should begin with a title header:

```
Ruby on Rails
=============
```

Sections should be used to organize content within the file:

```
Testing
-------
```

Ordered lists are helpful for easy reference:

```
1.  This is the first convention.
2.  This is another convention.
3.  And another convention.
```

Contributing
------------

Discussion on new and existing conventions should happen first using GitHub
Issues. Once the conventions are agreed upon, create a Pull Request with the
changes.
