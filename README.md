Standards
=========

Coding and development standards that we follow on the Engineering team.

Organization
------------

There should be one [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
file per topic, whether that's a language, framework, tool, etc. For example,
all standards dealing with the Ruby language should be placed in `ruby.md`. Ruby
on Rails standards can be included in the same file, but should be split out to
`ruby_on_rails.md` when they become significant enough.

Format
------

Each Markdown file should begin with a title header:

```
Ruby on Rails
=============
```

Sections should be used to organize content within the file:

```
Testing
-------
```

Ordered lists are helpful for easy reference:

```
1.  This is the first standard.
2.  This is another standard.
3.  And another standard.
```
