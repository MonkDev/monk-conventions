HTML & CSS
==========

1.  We adhere to the [Code Guide](http://codeguide.co) by the author of
    [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). [SCSS-Lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint)
    should be used to detect violations of the standard.
2.  We adhere to [SMACSS](http://smacss.com) for organization and architecture.
3.  Dependency management should be done with [Bower](http://bower.io) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.org).
4.  Code documentation should be done with [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss).
5.  Preprocessing should be done with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com).
6.  Minification should be done as part of the build process with tools such as
    [grunt-contrib-htmlmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-htmlmin),
    [grunt-contrib-cssmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin), and
    [grunt-contrib-imagemin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin).
7.  Browser normalization should be done with [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
8.  We support the [same browsers and devices as Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support)
    with one exception: IE 9 and above, instead of IE 8 and above.
